[![NuGet package](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/CG.Pluralization.svg)](https://nuget.org/packages/CG.Pluralization)

The package contains a private, portable (by 'portable' I mean .NET, .NET Standard, or .NET Core) build of the .NET pluralization service in the System.Data.Entity.Design assembly.

All the code was found here: https://github.com/Microsoft/referencesource/tree/master/System.Data.Entity.Design/System/Data/Entity/Design/PluralizationService

I created this assembly because I needed a pluralization service that would behave in a predictable manner and work with whatever platform/version I was targeting.
